## DESCRIPTION
Using Visual Basic for Application(VBA) tool to perform effective analysis on stock data.
Note: (All Stocks Analysis) contains the refactor code

### SITUATION/TASK
Create a VBA macro that can trigger pop-ups and inputs, read and change cell values, and format cells. Also, use for loops
and conditionals to direct logic flow. Use nested for loops.

### APPROACH
Used VBA to write scripts to automate simple tasks. Applied coding skills such as syntax recollection, pattern recognition, problem decomposition, and debugging.

### RESULTS
Performed complex analyses, which we wouldnâ€™t be able to do with Excel alone.

### THINGS LEARNED
* Learning the fundamental building blocks of programming languages.
* Learning how to programmatically analyze data.
